// Simple program “rock paper scissors”

I made a simple implementation of grade-school classic “rock paper scissors”.

It is my first program made by JavaScript.

For the moment the game works from the browser console, but I will revisit this project in a later lesson and add a Graphical User Interface with buttons and text.
